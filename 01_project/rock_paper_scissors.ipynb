    "Features of this implementation:\n",
    "Clear Instructions: Explains the rules at the start\n",
    "Input Validation: Ensures user enters valid choices (\"rock\", \"paper\", or \"scissors\")\n",
    "Multiple Rounds: Players can play as many rounds as they want\n",
    "Score Tracking: Keeps track of wins, losses, and ties\n",
    "Clean Output: Clearly displays choices and results each round\n",
    "Final Summary: Shows final score and overall winner\n",
    "User-Friendly: Accepts \"y\"/\"n\" as well as \"yes\"/\"no\" for continuing\n",

    "The game follows standard Rock, Paper, Scissors rules:\n",
